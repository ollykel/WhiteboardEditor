// === currentEditorsByCanvasSlice =============================================
//
// Tracks which active user is currently editing each canvas.
//
// This is an optional one-to-one relationship: each canvas has at most one
// current editor, and each client is currently editing at most one canvas. As
// such, two dictionaries must be maintained to ensure the mapping is
// one-to-one.
