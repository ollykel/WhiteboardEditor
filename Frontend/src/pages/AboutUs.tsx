            <p>
              Boardly was created in the summer of 2025 by two friends at UC Irvine who had worked on enough projects to know how quickly a shared whiteboard can turn into a mess. After watching diagrams shift, disappear, and mysteriously reappear, we decided there had to be a better way. Instead of accepting the chaos, we started building a space where collaboration stays clear and intentional.
            </p>
            <p>
              Boardly gives people the freedom to think together without losing ownership of their work. You can open the door to others or keep things focused until the time is right. Real time collaboration should feel organized, not overwhelming, and that idea continues to guide every decision we make.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are still shaping Boardly and adding features that support the way people actually work. It is an evolving project, and we are committed to improving it step by step. For those who like following products as they grow, stay tuned. There is more on the horizon.
